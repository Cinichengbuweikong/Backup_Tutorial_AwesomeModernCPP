# span: A Non-owning Contiguous View

## What is a span: A pointer plus a size, that's it

`std::span` is the standard view provided by C++20 for "a contiguous sequence of data". It does not own the memory; it only holds two things: a pointer and a size. It's that simple—you can think of it as a "pointer with boundary information," or a formal wrapper for the C-style `(ptr, len)` argument pair. It doesn't allocate, deallocate, or copy the underlying data. Copying a span just means copying those two words (the pointer and the size), which is extremely cheap.

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4};
std::span<int> s(v);       // s 指向 v 的数据，但不拥有
s.size();                  // 4
s[0];                      // 1
s.data() == v.data();      // true
```

Its core value lies in "passing parameters": when a function needs to accept "a contiguous sequence of `T`," using `std::span<const T>` allows it to uniformly accept C arrays, `std::array`, `std::vector`, and `(pointer, length)` pairs, among other contiguous sources. It neither copies data nor requires the function to be implemented as a template.

## Why we need it: The pitfalls of the pointer-plus-length approach

In C/C++, the traditional way to pass "a chunk of memory" to a function is `void f(T* ptr, std::size_t n)`. This works, but it has several drawbacks: the unit of the length `n` (elements vs. bytes) relies on comments or guesswork; whether the function modifies data depends on spotting `T*` vs. `const T*`, which is easy to miss; there is no compile-time protection if the caller passes the wrong length; and these two parameters must always be passed and remembered together. `span` bundles the pointer and length into a single object, where the type (`span<const T>` vs. `span<T>`) directly expresses read-only or read-write intent, and the length stays with the object, so it cannot be lost.

```cpp
// 老办法：长度单位、只读与否全靠注释
void process_old(const uint8_t* buf, std::size_t n);

// span 办法：类型即语义
void process(std::span<const uint8_t> buf);   // 明确：只读，长度内建
void mutate(std::span<uint8_t> buf);          // 明确：会改，长度内建
```

This is also less hassle than writing `template<class C> void process(const C& c)`—we don't need to instantiate a version for every container, which avoids code bloat.

## Dynamic Extent vs. Static Extent

`span` comes in two forms, differing in whether the "length is stored at runtime or fixed at compile time". `std::span<T>` (fully written as `std::span<T, std::dynamic_extent>`) has **dynamic extent**: the length is stored as a member and is determined at runtime. `std::span<T, N>` has **static extent**: the length `N` is fixed at compile time and is not stored in the object.

This difference is directly reflected in `sizeof`—we will test this in a moment. Dynamic extent stores a pointer + size (two words), while static extent only stores a pointer (the size is known at compile time, so it is omitted). In practice, dynamic extent is more common (since data length is often only known at runtime), while static extent is suitable for cases where "we know it is exactly N elements", saving a word of storage and gaining some compile-time checks.

```cpp
int arr[4];
std::span<int, 4> s_fixed(arr);     // 只能绑长度 4 的数据
std::span<int>    s_dyn(arr);       // 任意长度，运行时记 4
```

## Accepting any contiguous source: array / vector / C array / pointer+length

`span` constructors cover almost all contiguous data sources, allowing us to unify function parameters with `span`:

```cpp
void print(std::span<const int> s);

int buf[] = {0x10, 0x20, 0x30};
std::array<int, 3> a = {1, 2, 3};
std::vector<int>   v = {4, 5, 6, 7};
int* p = v.data();

print(buf);                 // C 数组（自动推 N）
print(a);                   // std::array
print(v);                   // std::vector
print({p, 2});              // 指针 + 长度
```

The caller does not need to copy data, and the function does not need to write overloads or templates for every container type. Note that `span<const T>` represents a read-only view—if the function needs to modify data, use `span<T>` (non-const).

## subspan, first, last: Zero-Copy Slicing

`span` provides a trio of tools: `subspan(offset, count)`, `first(n)`, and `last(n)`. These return a new `span` (still a non-owning view) without copying any data. This is particularly handy for protocol parsing and buffer handling—splitting a large buffer into header and payload, and passing them on as `span`s:

```cpp
void recv_packet(std::span<uint8_t> buffer)
{
    if (buffer.size() < 4) {
        return;
    }
    auto header  = buffer.first(4);          // 前 4 字节视图
    uint16_t len = static_cast<uint16_t>(header[2] | (header[3] << 8));
    if (buffer.size() < 4 + len) {
        return;
    }
    auto payload = buffer.subspan(4, len);   // 跳过 header 取 payload 视图
    // payload 仍是非拥有视图，零拷贝
}
```

Throughout this process, no bytes are copied; the sliced `header` and `payload` point directly into the original `buffer`.

## Byte View: as_bytes / as_writable_bytes

When handling binary data, we often need to treat a `span<T>` as raw bytes. `std::as_bytes(s)` returns a `span<const std::byte>`, while `std::as_writable_bytes(s)` returns a `span<std::byte>` (only available when `T` is not const). This is ideal for scenarios like CRC calculation, serialization, and memory dumps, where we need to "treat a structure as a byte stream":

```cpp
std::span<int> data = /* ... */;
auto bytes = std::as_bytes(data);          // span<const std::byte>，只读字节
// crc(bytes.data(), bytes.size());
```

Distinguish between read-only and writable access: use `as_bytes` for reading, and use `as_writable_bytes` for in-place byte modification (and the underlying span must be non-const).

## Lifetime: A span does not own data, so dangling references will bite

The biggest pitfall of `span`, and the inevitable cost of its "non-owning" nature, is that **it does not manage the lifetime of the underlying memory**. The span can only live as long as the underlying data; once the underlying data is gone, the span becomes a dangling view, and accessing it results in undefined behavior. The classic mistake is binding a span to a temporary object and then returning it:

```cpp
std::span<int> bad()
{
    std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
    return v;   // v 在函数结束时销毁，返回的 span 立刻悬垂
}
```

If the caller holds onto this `span` and accesses it later, they are accessing freed memory. Remember this golden rule: **the lifetime of a `span` must not exceed the lifetime of the data it points to**. As long as you don't bind a `span` to a temporary, or store it longer than the underlying data, it is safe.

## Let's Run It: `sizeof` Dynamic vs. Static Extents

Earlier, we mentioned that a dynamic extent stores two words, while a static extent stores only a pointer. Let's verify this by running the code:

```cpp
#include <span>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int arr[4] = {};
    std::span<int>        dyn;            // 动态 extent：可默认构造（空 span）
    std::span<int, 4>     fixed(arr);     // 静态 extent：必须绑定数据
    std::cout << "sizeof(span<int>)    = " << sizeof(dyn) << '\n';
    std::cout << "sizeof(span<int,4>)  = " << sizeof(fixed) << '\n';
    std::cout << "sizeof(void*)        = " << sizeof(void*) << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -o /tmp/span_sizeof /tmp/span_sizeof.cpp && /tmp/span_sizeof
```

```text
sizeof(span<int>)    = 16
sizeof(span<int,4>)  = 8
sizeof(void*)        = 8
```

(64-bit platform, GCC 16.1.1.) The dynamic extent is 16 bytes (one 8-byte pointer + one 8-byte size), while the static extent is only 8 bytes (just a pointer, as the size is known at compile time and omitted). This is the storage advantage of static extent—in scenarios where we pass a large number of spans (such as buffer views, which are everywhere in embedded systems), saving half the bytes is significant.

## Extension: span in Embedded Systems (DMA / Protocol Parsing)

Because `span` is lightweight, zero-copy, and consistent across containers, it is essentially the "modern buffer pointer" in embedded development. Here are a few practical usage patterns (supplementary to the main thread, use as needed). After a DMA callback places data into a fixed buffer, we use `span` slicing to parse the header and payload without copying; when reading data from Flash into a buffer, we use `span` to chunk the processing; when passing small pieces of data in interrupts or real-time paths, copying a `span` is cheap (just two words). As long as we adhere to the rule that "a span does not own the data and must not outlive the underlying lifetime," it serves as a safe replacement for raw pointers.

## Wrapping Up: How to Distinguish Between span and string_view

Both `span` and `string_view` are "non-owning views," and the distinction lies in the element type: `span<T>` is generic for any element type (including writable ones and `std::byte`), whereas `string_view` is specifically for character sequences (read-only, with string semantics). We use `span` for binary buffers or arbitrary data, and `string_view` for text. To remember `span` in one sentence: it is the formal encapsulation of a pointer plus a length, offering unified parameter passing and zero-copy slicing, but we must manage the lifetimes ourselves.
